# Day 04

This is one of those challanges where my compression background helped a lot.  
I've probably written this overlap function a million times and I've thought  
about it in all the ways possible - what's the fastest implementation, what's  
the shortest one, what's the cleanest one.

I am, however, getting faster and faster solving each new day. I first had a  
bug where I wasn't casting the inputs to integers but python was letting me  
compare them anyway; see, that's the reason dynamic languages are a double  
edged sword - I spent way too much time to spot this, it's not a very verbose  
bug. Waking up this early is also a big commitment but I feel like I'll get  
fully used to it in 3-4 more days.
