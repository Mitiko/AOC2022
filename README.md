# Advent of Code 2022

This is my working directory for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) 2022.  
This is my first year trying this out, and I'm going for speed of development.  
Get to solution as fast as possible, refactor (just a bit) later.

I'm trying to get more into python and the challenges don't seem to need
too much speed so this is my choice.
