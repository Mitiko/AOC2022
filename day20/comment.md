# Day 20

I slept in today, didn't feel like it..
I know there're probably better ways to write this but I don't think I've ever
actually written doubly linked lists, not in Rust, anyway.

Part 2 was quite easy.. I suppose if this weren't python, you'd try pre-modulo your values
and keep track of indexes or smth, and only later on reverse the modulo ops to actually be
the full multiplication with big integers. Idk, does the multiplier fit in 64 bits?
Oh, it's about 30-bits and my input file isn't that large, so it would've probably been just fine.
