# Day 18

Part 1 was exceptiobnally easy.  
For part 2 I initially tried finding all the tunnels inside and substracting the stuff I shouldn't count.
This however brought me results too big -> I wasn't getting all the tunnels for some reason.

Anyway, it's the same BFS graph walk on the outside, so I rewrote it to find the answer directly.
