# Day 11

I had to be at school at 8:00, so I couldn't finish the second part on time but
I came up with the solution on the drive there, and called my brother to type it up for me
thinking luckily he just started programming and he'd also have an easy time with python
but I was wrong..
He said my solution was wrong but turns out he just didn't write it properly and was embarassed to
tell me. I asked him to send me the code and I did it myself on my phone.
