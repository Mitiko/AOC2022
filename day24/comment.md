# Day 24

Again, woke up at 8:00.  
Today was pretty fun I guess, I'm just slightly getting tired of fixing off-by-one errors
and wraps around edges but I guess that's mainly what gamedevs did back in the 90s.  
I gave in to premature optimization (storing blizzards as bitmasks), in fact,
I went on a bit of a tangent to check what sizes ints and strings are in python.
I also forgot to prune my tree, moved to sets and it all worked out, but I wrote a
visualization function in the process...

Part 2 was pretty fun again. Too lazy to write a function, but also, practice some WET (write everything twice).
Just swap the goal and start and run them again. Speed wasn't an issue, perhaps thanks to my premature optimizing.

I'm not gonna be hoem for Christmass, so we'll see how tomorrow goes when I'm not on my computer.
The most desperate case is doing it on my phone but let's hope I find some laptop and run python on it.
